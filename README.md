I am a statistician (some say data scientist) and software developer. I am particularly interested in Bayesian statistics and generative modeling, MCMC samplers and symbolic programming.

I am the author of [Blackjax](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax) and a core member of [Aesara](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aesara).
