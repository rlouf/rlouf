I am a glorified statistician and software developer. I am particularly interested in Bayesian statistics and generative modeling, MCMC samplers and symbolic programming.

### What I write for others

- **[Pollsposition](https://github.com/pollsposition)** is an election forecasting project.
- **[Ddoxa](https://www.ddoxa.fr)** is a set of short data-driven notes (in French) on economics and politics ([repo](https://github.com/rlouf/ddoxa))
- **[Blog](https://thetypicalset.com/blog)**

### Development

- **[Aemcmc](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aemcmc)** is a framework to build efficient samplers for probabilistic models automatically <img align="right" alt="GitHub Repo stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/aesara-devs/aemcmc?style=social">
- **[Blackjax](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax)** is a sampling library (written with JAX) designed for speed, ease of use and modularity. The original purpose of the library was to learn how MCMC samplers work, and it got out of hand. <img align="right" alt="GitHub Repo stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/blackjax-devs/blackjax?style=social">
- **[Aehmc](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aehmc)** provides symbolic implementations of MCMC samplers from the HMC family. <img align="right" alt="GitHub Repo stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/aesara-devs/aehmc?style=social">
- **[MCX](https://github.com/rlouf/mcx)** was a probabilistic programming language written with JAX. Deprecated in favor of **[Aeppl](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aeppl)**. <img align="right" alt="GitHub Repo stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/rlouf/mcx?style=social">

### Experiments

- **[The typical set](https://thetypicalset.com/)** a subset of my personal notes displayed as a graph. This is both an experiment in note taking and how to display knowledge graphs ([repo](https://github.com/rlouf/thetypicalset))
